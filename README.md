Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family.
In this project, you’ll build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.
Project Feautures : Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
Allow your user to change sort order via a setting . The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated .
Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as: 
• original title • movie poster image thumbnail
• A plot synopsis (called overview in the api) 
• user rating (called vote_average in the api) 
• release date • You’ll allow users to view and play trailers in the youtube.
• You’ll allow users to read reviews of a selected movie.
• You’ll also allow users to mark a movie as a favorite in the details view by tapping a button(star).
This is for a local movies collection that you will maintain and does not require an API request .
